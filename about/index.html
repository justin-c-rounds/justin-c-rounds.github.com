  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am an artist and educator currently living and working in Boston, Massachusetts. My work primarily investigates dynamics of power and control as they relate to culture and society.</p>
  <p>My processes emerge from the intersection of art and technology, and I employ painting, performance, and interactivity in my work. As an educator I enjoy teaching others how to use technology creatively.</p>
