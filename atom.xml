    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been growing increasingly dissatisfied with my exceedingly &#8220;default&#8221; Wordpress website, but I haven&#8217;t taken any time to mess around with other options. I love Tumblr and may just use that for my regular posting, however being a web dev sometimes I&#8217;d like something a bit more customizable. So I&#8217;m checking out Octopress!</p>

<p>Installation and configuration was pretty simple, although due to some weirdness with my ruby environment I had to clone the octopress repo into a separate directory and then copy files over to my working directory. I suspect there were issues with the build of ruby-1.9.3-p0, but so far my old ruby 1.9.2p290 install is working fine. I&#8217;m looking forward to hacking on Octopress and I love the fact I can just deploy to Github or Heroku or wherever.</p>
