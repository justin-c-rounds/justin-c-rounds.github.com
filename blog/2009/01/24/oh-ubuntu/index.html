<div class="entry-content"><p>I am a card-carrying Mac user, ever since OSX came along, but before that (and after an abusive relationship with Windows), I started getting into Linux and learning all the gnarly bits to actually get some real use out of my aging PCs. Nowadays I really like Ubuntu. As much as I am a technophile, I have gone beyond the point where fiddling with software to get it running is anything less than annoying; if it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;just work&#8221;, then I&#8217;m out. Ubuntu has that &#8220;it just works&#8221; feel to it, and I&#8217;ve had such a good experience with it that it has become my Linux distro of choice. But sadly, Ubuntu and I have come to an impasse (at least in <em>this</em> case).</p>

<p>I applaud the work of Linux developers &#8211; I get &#8220;Hulk smash&#8221; angry just making a website behave in Internet Explorer, and I can&#8217;t imagine what it must be like trying to make an operating system that will run on the myriad configurations of hardware out there in PC-land. This particular configuration, an old Sony Vaio PCG-FX390K laptop, is one such hobgoblin.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had this thing sitting around unused for far too long, but lately have decided to try and get some use out of it. Reluctantly I put a fresh install of Win2k (the OS it came with) to run Fruityloops, but I soon realized that the management of yet another install of Windows (my Macs run Boot Camp with XP) was something I just didn&#8217;t want to do. That, and FL was glitchy and somewhat less than usable on it. At this point I probably should have just thrown it down the stairs, called the incident &#8220;an unfortunate accident&#8221;, and moved on. But being the obsessive person I am, I couldn&#8217;t let it go. <em>I have trouble letting things go, you know.</em></p>

<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s where it starts to get interesting. No, really. Maybe. Since I decided I didn&#8217;t want a mostly useless Win2k lappy sitting around, I realized what I really could use was a machine for recording audio that could serve as a web-surfing machine for those days when I don&#8217;t extricate my MacBook from its life-support system of peripherals and external hard drives on my office desk. &#8220;Good idea&#8221; I say to myself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just install Ubuntu on it and see how it goes&#8221;.</p>

<p>Linux Live CDs are awesome. Seriously. I popped in the Ubuntu 8.10 CD and watched the old lappy being reborn&#8230; except for one annoying little problem. The sad little Intel 815em integrated graphics chip was unrecognized, suffering at a miserable default resolution of 800x600, which on this particular laptop leaves a thick black border around the screen and many OS windows dangling off the edge. Great. But everything else works. After some Googling I find I am not the only one with this screen rez problem, and sadly I am not the only one who has yet to find a solution. I tried a bunch of xorg.conf tricks, installed other flavors of Ubuntu, and got nowhere.</p>

<p>Time to try some other distros. UbuntuStudio and Linux Mint, both suffered the same problem (not surprisingly). Moving on to unknown (to me) distros, I decided to give Mandriva a shot, even though the system requirements were beyond my sorry old Vaio.</p>

<p>Bingo. Everything seems to be working great, except&#8230; Mandriva just has this &#8220;Windows&#8221; smell to it. From the installation &#8220;wizard&#8221; to the over-designed default theme, it feels a bit like WindowsXP, and maybe that is what the Mandriva team is going for. It certainly appears that they are trying to be a Windows-alternative rather than a user-friendly Linux distro. Hopefully with some theme tweaking it&#8217;ll feel less icky.</p>
