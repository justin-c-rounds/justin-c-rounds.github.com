<div class="entry-content"><p>The day before yesterday I started playing Fable — <strong>not</strong> Fable II, although it&#8217;s sitting in the &#8220;must play someday&#8221; pile along with about a hundred other games — on my dust-laden <em>original</em> Xbox. After recovering from the &#8220;wow these graphics are really bad&#8221; effect usually caused by firing up a game more than five years old, I started to settle in and really enjoy the game. I got almost finished with the guild training exercises (so about an hour in), decided to call it a night, and went to save my game. &#8220;Your quests will not be saved&#8230;&#8221; — huh? So you&#8217;re telling me that my quests will not be saved, but all my stats will be saved? I looked around for another save option&#8230; nothing. This can&#8217;t be right, right?</p>

<p>So last night I go to &#8220;continue&#8221; where I left off, load my save file, and sure enough I&#8217;m right back at the beginning of the guild training. My first inclination was to turn it off and never play it again, but I managed to plow through the guild quests and training exercises (again), and make it to the next autosave point, from which I was sure to be able to resume. I was annoyed, but mostly confused at the design decision. I mean <em>it was intentional, right?</em> There is no technical reason why &#8220;save anywhere&#8221; <em>can&#8217;t</em> work on a console (feel free to argue with me), especially on a console with a built-in hard drive. PC developers have been doing it by default for years. So let&#8217;s assume, and I may be completely wrong, Fable&#8217;s save system is by design. <em>Why?</em></p>

<p>In defense of these kinds of save points, saving where a particular point in a game timeline is reached, they provide a nice clean point from which to resume, much like reading to the end of a chapter of a book before placing a bookmark. From a development standpoint, all the events and assets from before the point can be swept in the garbage, leaving the memory clear for the next chapter to be constructed. Unload the old, load in the new, and only maintain the necessary data to transition over. I get it. It makes sense for an <em>autosave</em> system, and a lot of games do it effectively (Half-Life 2&#8217;s implementation comes to mind). But forcing the player to effectively restart an entire chapter, whether their stats are retained or not, doesn&#8217;t make sense. Especially for a game like Fable.</p>

<p>Fable is all about cause and effect, at least in theory. You make choices and live with the consequences, whatever they may be. Playing with this system is inherently where the fun lies, and either the player can be encouraged to try different things and see the results, or the player can be forced to deal with the consequences of their actions. Fable leans toward the latter approach, and in my opinion, it hurts the experience of the game.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s compare Fable with any similar PC RPG with a sensible &#8220;save anywhere&#8221; system. The player is faced with a challenge and presented a number of possible actions. In a &#8220;save anywhere&#8221; system, the player can experiment with any number of options to overcome the challenge, since the player can always restore from a convenient save point and try for a better outcome. In Fable, this option is discouraged, since re-trying would involve (potentially) a lot of replaying, and therefore the player is encouraged to accept (or suffer) the consequences. In playing the game, I can&#8217;t help but feel like I&#8217;m being manipulated into participating in a system that I feel is inherently broken. I should be able to experiment, play, go back and try different things, and not feel like I just blew it because I shot someone accidentally while aiming at a sparrow&#8230; But maybe that is the point; I am invested in my actions and their consequences, for what it is worth.</p>

<p>That said, I can&#8217;t help but feel I should be invested in the consequences of my actions for some reason <em>other</em> than not wanting to have to replay a section of a game.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s take it to the extreme: what if there was no user-directed save system at all? Instead, the game continually autosaved, so at any point in the game the player could quit and start up again exactly where they left off? No replaying, no second chances — wouldn&#8217;t this work better for Fable than a chapter-based autosave system?</p>
