<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A content management system (CMS) is a computer application that supports the creation and modification of digital content. It is often used to support multiple users working in a collaborative environment.</p>
<p>CMS features vary widely. Most CMSs include Web-based publishing, format management, history editing and version control, indexing, search, and retrieval. By their nature, content management systems support the separation of content and presentation.</p>
<p>A web content management system (WCM or WCMS) is a CMS designed to support the management of the content of Web pages. Most popular CMSs are also WCMSs. Web content includes text and embedded graphics, photos, video, audio, maps, and program code (e.g., for applications) that displays content or interacts with the user.</p>
<p>Such a content management system (CMS) typically has two major components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A content management application (CMA) is the front-end user interface that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, and remove content from a website without the intervention of a webmaster.</li>
<li>A content delivery application (CDA) compiles that information and updates the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital asset management systems are another type of CMS. They manage things such as documents, movies, pictures, phone numbers, and scientific data. CMSs can also be used for storing, controlling, revising, and publishing documentation.</p>
<p>Based on market share statistics, the most popular content management system is WordPress, used by over 27% of websites on the internet. Other popular content management systems include Joomla and Drupal.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;ve used a CMS at work, or for your own personal website. A CMS is most useful for separating design and layout from content. A blog is a common application of a CMS.</p>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>Unlike creating individual web pages by hand, a CMS uses one or more <em>templates</em> which contain empty areas for content. The content is then added to the template on the web server before the page is sent to the browser. Templates are generally a hybrid of HTML, CSS, and a server-side programming language such as PHP.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p><em>Content</em> comprises text and multimedia displayed on a website. It does not contain any styling information to determine how it is displayed, it only refers to the data itself. Content is generally stored in a database on the web server or on a content server connected to the web server.</p>
<h2 id="administration">Administration</h2>
<p>Most CMS software is administered through a <em>web application</em>, often referred to as an &quot;admin interface&quot;. The admin interface is a special password-protected website which allows a user to access and make changes to the CMS and its content through a web interface in a browser.</p>
<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
<p>Generally a CMS allows more than one user to add and edit content. Users often have different <em>roles</em> which control access to various tools and settings in the CMS. Think of a newspaper, where many reporters write articles, but an editor manages which articles get printed.</p>
