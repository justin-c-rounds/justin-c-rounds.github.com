<p>Responsive Design is the practice of designing websites to respond appropriately to varying devices, screen sizes, and user preferences.</p>
<h2 id="fluid-layout">Fluid layout</h2>
<p>A fluid (aka liquid) layout allows content to flow elegantly regardless of browser window size.</p>
<p>See an example of a fluid layout.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>There are several ways to create fluid layouts, but in general, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never use px units in CSS, only use em, rem, or percentage-based sizes.</li>
<li>Learn how CSS positioning works. Absolute positioning has a bad reputation, but it can be used to easily create layouts which stretch with changes in browser window size.</li>
<li>Allow content to flow like water. To change its shape, adjust its container.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="media-queries">Media Queries</h2>
<p>Media queries are used to apply different CSS rules to web pages based on display device, screen size, orientation, and other criteria.</p>
<h2 id="flexible-images">Flexible Images</h2>
<p>Flexible images do not break the layout due to fixed pixel sizes and will shrink (or stretch) to accommodate their containing elements.</p>
