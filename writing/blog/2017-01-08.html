<h1 id="opportunity-knocks">Opportunity Knocks</h1>
<p>I&#39;m happy to announce that I am a recipient of an <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-walsh-launches-boston-artist-opportunity-fund" target="_blank">Opportunity Fund</a> grant, which I am planning to use towards a new membership at <a href="http://atlanticworks.org/gallery/" target="_blank">Atlantic Works Gallery</a>, a co-op gallery in my studio building in East Boston. I&#39;ve been a supporter of AWG for a while now and love the community and the space, so I&#39;m very excited to have the ability to apply (and pay!) for membership.</p>
