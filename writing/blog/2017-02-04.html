<h1 id="increase-the-peace">Increase the Peace</h1>
<p>Last night I watched <em>Boyz n the Hood</em> for the first time. In the early nineties I cut myself off from mainstream media, so there are a number of movies from that time period which I totally missed. <em>Boyz n the Hood</em> (released in 1991) was one of them.</p>
<p>One of the opening scenes depicts a Reagan re-election campaign poster riddled by bullets. Although the film is full of gripping, insightful scenes, this one is deeply disturbing to me in a way I had not felt in years. Folks who grew up in the eighties might recall the hopelessness and madness of the Reagan administration. The implosion of the counter-culture in our recent history, the AIDS crisis, the Ethiopian famine, the insanity of trickle-down economics, and the threat of nuclear war created an atmosphere of dystopia that made the thought of growing up miserable.</p>

Don&#39;t be told what you need<br>
There&#39;s no future<br>
No future<br>
No future for you<br>

<p>A nice lady on a plane once told me that my generation (&quot;Gen X&quot;) was waiting for a bus that would never arrive. We were raised with a promise of prosperity if we worked hard and played along. Trust the system. The same system that was letting corporations poison the planet, imprisoning people of color behind bars or in poverty, de-funding social services, war-mongering at home and abroad, and marching us all toward assured mutual destruction? <strong>No fucking way.</strong> But what was the alternative? There wasn&#39;t one.</p>
<p>I was essentially radicalized at this time, but the form it took was counter-productive. I would bury myself in the fantasies of comic books and video games, trying to escape the feeling of powerlessness. I would vent through skateboard, pen, and punk. Never really getting anywhere because there was nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Since then, I have become more aware of just <em>how</em> broken &quot;the system&quot; is, both in terms of degree and manner, but I fight against the hopelessness every day. I fight because I realized that hopelessness is just a tool of oppression. We are made to feel hopeless, to feel that there is no future, so that we will not resist. Meanwhile, the &quot;future&quot; — i.e. the way we would have the world become — is taken from us by those who seek to control it.</p>
<p>The end of <em>Boyz n the Hood</em> shows the title with the words &quot;INCREASE THE PEACE&quot;. While this could easily be seen as merely a call to young black men to work towards non-violence, I believe this call goes out to us all, not just to soothe the symptom, but to cure the disease. The system of oppression that created the world depicted in the film is the same system of oppression operating today.</p>
<p>No justice, no peace.</p>
<p>Increase the justice, increase the peace.</p>
