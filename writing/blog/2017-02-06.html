<h1 id="gentrification-is-displacement">Gentrification is Displacement</h1>
<p>There are plastic signs zip-tied to lamp-posts in my neighborhood with the words &quot;COMPRAMOS CASAS&quot; (&quot;WE BUY HOUSES&quot;) on them. I&#39;ve seen similar signs, &quot;I Buy Houses CA$H&quot; et al. East Boston is referred to as &quot;one of the hottest real estate markets&quot;. The COMPRAMOS CASAS signs appear to be put up by <a href="http://acreb.com/" target="_blank">Aquasvivas Creative Real Estate Buyers, LLC</a> â€” their website address and phone number are printed on the signs.</p>
<p>Their website presents them as being sympathetic and helpful to people who are &quot;unable to keep their homes&quot;, but these people are simply vultures looking to profit off the misfortune of others. Instead of actually helping people keep their homes and prevent displacement, or act as an agent to help them get the most value for their home through a sale, they are seeking to take advantage of the real estate market boom by flipping the houses they buy. Logic dictates that the homeowners would never actually get fair market value for their home by selling to these people, and they have no interest in helping people accomplish this through a partnership or by providing any kind of service.</p>
<p>If you see these signs, take them down. Many are posted illegally anyway and these companies are a threat to your communities. Shame these companies on social media. Counter them with advertisements in local newspapers and posted flyers. Encourage neighbors to seek FREE help from programs like <a href="https://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/" target="_blank">Making Home Affordable</a> or discuss other options like conversion to affordable rental housing, selling to a local housing co-op, or at least selling through a qualified real estate agent.</p>
<p>Gentrification is a real threat which should not be whitewashed as &quot;progress&quot; nor accepted as the natural order of things. Displacement is unnatural, oppressive, and destructive to communities, especially communities of color. <strong>Fight against it.</strong></p>
