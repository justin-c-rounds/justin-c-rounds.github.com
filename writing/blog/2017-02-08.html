<h1 id="snow-day">Snow Day</h1>
<p>Yesterday was a snow-day for the public school system. The schools were closed and road conditions were unsuitable for driving or walking. Presumably, people should stay off the roads to allow trained crews to remove snow and clear sidewalks. So why don&#39;t we all just have a snow-day?</p>
<p>Imagine you work at an office job. The weather is crap, and driving is going to suck. At best it&#39;ll be slow, at worst there will be an accident due to poor road conditions. Or maybe you take public transportation, in which case the sidewalks are going to be slippery and buses will be delayed. If you are in a wheelchair, it would be even more difficult.</p>
<p>Imagine the only way you can work at your office job is because your kids are in school during the day. The school is closed, so you have to stay home with your kids. Maybe you can work from home, maybe you can&#39;t. Maybe you have to take a personal day to avoid losing pay. Maybe you fall behind on your work and your &quot;performance&quot; is affected.</p>
<p>Imagine your job is to clear the roads of snow and ice. The snow is falling fast and you are trying to keep up with it, but there is traffic from people trying to get to their office jobs. Maybe there is an accident you have to work around.</p>
<p>Imagine instead non-critical systems are closed due to the weather, and we all simply accept this as the most reasonable thing to do. You stay home, hang out with your kids, shovel your driveway, and help your neighbors. You aren&#39;t punished by your job because this is &quot;the most reasonable thing to do&quot;. The road crews get their work done quickly and efficiently because there are fewer vehicles on the road. Ambulances, fire trucks, and buses (yes public transit is a critical system) aren&#39;t slowed by traffic or accidents.</p>
<p>So why don&#39;t we all just have a snow-day?</p>
