<h1 id="fail-harder-not-just-faster-">Fail Harder (Not Just Faster)</h1>
<p>Recently I was invited to a student-run group meeting where current digital media students and recent graduates gave some excellent presentations about things they had learned and advice for other students. Much of it was spot-on: why homework should be treated as opportunity, being a proactive learner, etc.. I was also invited to say a few words of my own. I accepted, even though I was completely unprepared to do so, but there were some themes to the presentations I wanted to highlight (and some warnings I wanted to give).</p>
<h2 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h2>
<p>Following own&#39;s heart, nose, inner voice, etc. is the key to everything. One of the fundamentally broken parts of our educational system is how gaining knowledge is presented as an obstacle to be surmounted instead of its own reward. I have students who fail to complete homework because they are required to take my class and it isn&#39;t in their area of focus. They simply aren&#39;t curious about what I am teaching. Would it be so terrible to simply let students choose what they want to learn?</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>I think design is about defining and expressing purpose. A well-designed tool is true to its purpose. The same goes for human beings. We are the designers of our lives, defining and expressing our purpose. And our curiosity guides us towards our purpose. But unlike the purpose of a tool, I believe our purpose is a shifting, mercurial thing. We think we have found it, but then we feel like it&#39;s elsewhere. This is not surprising — we grow and change with experience. As we experience new things, we learn more about what works and what doesn&#39;t. Unfortunately, I think a by-product of our consumer society is that we are often presented with solutions, and we spend too much effort trying to make our problems fit the solutions. We are told the &quot;why&quot; and the &quot;how&quot; instead of coming to our own conclusions. I am still new to teaching, but one thing seems true: education is more about providing a means for exploration than it is about mechanics and information.</p>
<h2 id="jobs">Jobs</h2>
<p>Part of the problem I struggle with in my teaching is the false truth of education being a path to employment being a path to well-being. Not that it is 100% false, but it is completely subjective. One of the digital media students in the group asked whether it was important to focus on learning one particular software application versus learning many in various domains, in order to get a job. I explained that most job descriptions in my experience aren&#39;t actually written by people who know what they need (they either don&#39;t know what they need or they are not the ones doing the actual hiring evaluation). I argued if a company wasn&#39;t willing to let you learn on the job, you should find another company, because they aren&#39;t investing in you as a person. Whether someone knows Photoshop or Sketch or not is far less important than whether they are a good designer or not.</p>
<p>I told the students how the word &quot;career&quot; relates to &quot;careen&quot;, and detailed my own twisty path from job to job. I explained how I kept trying different things to find my purpose. I&#39;m still trying. And trying means <em>failing</em>. <strong>A lot.</strong></p>
<h2 id="success">Success</h2>
<p>It has been said to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/05/fail-fast-fail-often-how-losing-can-help-you-win.html" target="_blank">&quot;fail fast, fail often&quot;</a>, but I would add we should also <strong>fail harder</strong>. Let the failure risk as much as possible to destroy all things outside our purpose. Push all the envelopes! Test all the possibilities! It&#39;s not enough to say something won&#39;t work — you have to prove it!</p>
