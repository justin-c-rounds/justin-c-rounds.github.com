<h1 id="solidarity">Solidarity</h1>
<p>A recent conversation about the effects of gentrification on artists (and vice versa) moved from discussing the obvious problems of space/housing to the inevitable questionâ€¦</p>
<h2 id="-how-do-we-put-the-brakes-on-it-">&quot;How do we put the brakes on it?&quot;</h2>
<p>Artists and culture-workers have been viewed as both the vanguards and victims of gentrification, although <a href="http://createquity.com/2013/04/artists-and-gentrification-sticky-myths-slippery-realities/">this is more complicated than it would seem</a>. Regardless of how artists affect or are affected by gentrification, we can certainly do something about it. Perhaps what we need is to foster solidarity between artists, both within themselves and with other marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Boston is a city of fragmentation. Neighborhoods are mentally and physically cut off from each other. Culture-workers are nested in scattered pockets around the city and are generally too focused on their own backyard to think about what&#39;s happening next door.</p>
<p>Bringing artists together is a bit like herding cats, but like most things it just takes work. Organizing is key, so how do we organize? I think first and foremost we need to simply be present.</p>
<h3 id="show-up">Show up</h3>
<p>Attending gallery openings and artist talks, participating in open studios, and talking to each other face-to-face is the foundation of solidarity.</p>
<h3 id="speak-up-and-listen-up">Speak up and listen up</h3>
<p>Acknowledging our struggle and telling people about it spreads awareness of our cause, but also know when to listen, especially to those whose voices are historically under-/mis-represented (women, POC, the poor, et al). <em>Empathy needs to go both ways in order to affect change.</em> And without empathy, solidarity is powerless. We need to be able to think about how others are affected to have an inclusive and unifying platform. Without empathy, we cannot combat the othering that runs rampant in our city (and elsewhere).</p>
<h3 id="reach-out">Reach out</h3>
<p>Think about how you can connect with other culture-workers outside your circle of friends. Help each other. Promote each other&#39;s events. Be an amplifier for small voices.</p>
<p>If we can start creating systems of support, we can create solidarity, and then create change. Otherwise we will continue to remain isolated and disempowered.</p>
